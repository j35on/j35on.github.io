        <ol>
            <li>Submission goes to right place</li>
            <li>No spaces in file/folder names</li>
            <li>Design:
                <ol>
                    <li>Page does have sufficient contrast and font sizing, but red links can be a little difficult to read</li>
                    <li>Page uses its own css file</li>
                    <li>CRAP:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Contrast is good</li>
                            <li>Menus are repetitive, but site layout isn't. Some products have pictures while others don't. Some items are centered while others are not. This is not necessarily wrong, but I do not think it fits well here.</li>
                            <li>Alignment is not consistent.</li>
                            <li>Lots of whitespace. Something that stands out to me is how on the product page the item names are far away from their images.</li>
                            
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Page has within it:
                <ol>
                    <li>Page has header</li>
                    <li>Page has footer</li>
                    <li>Page has main</li>
                    <li>Page has navbar</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Header has brand in header with h1</li>
            <li>Main does not start with an h2</li>
            <li>Page has tagline, but not on every page</li>
            <li>Footer is missing menu, and both validatgion links</li>
            
        </ol>
        <h3>Suggestions/Comments:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Consider a different font for your pages.</li>
            <li>If you're not sure how you should align your page I would be safe and center everything.</li>
            <li>Fill up whitespace, especially in the about us section and reviews.</li>
            <li>Image is missing from gallery</li>
        </ul>
