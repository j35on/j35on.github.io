        <h3><a href="https://instagram.com">Instagram</a></h3>
        <p>Instagram is a social media platform that allows users to view and upload both videos and pictures to their accounts. Since its release in 2019, Instagram has become one of the most popular social media platforms.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>C</strong>ontrast: While Instagram uses colors that developers tend to avoid, black and white are a great contrast for one another. Content is easy to read and dark mode especially is easy on the eyes</li>
            <li><strong>R</strong>epetition: Instagram does especially well when it comes to repetition. Each post looks relatively the same besides the content itself. Account username is in the same place along with all the buttons the user can interact with.</li>
            <li><strong>A</strong>lignment: Instagram does suffer from a whitespace problem on the desktop version, but they do take measures to lessen the problem. When you first load the page there is whitespace between the left sidebar and the main content of the page, and the right sidebar and the main content of the page. Once you scroll down the entire right hand side of the page is whitespace. The page is generally neatly aligned</li>
            <li><strong>P</strong>roximity: Related buttons are grouped together. Similar elements are always found near each other.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a href="https://steakfry.neocities.org/">Steakfry</a></h3>
        <p>Steakfry is the personal website of an artist with the same name. His discography is shown on the website, along with options to buy merchandise.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>C</strong>ontrast: The contrast on this website does not look good. The background is an ugly dark red and the text is black.</li>
            <li><strong>R</strong>epetition: This component is lacking although there is not much content to repeat elements. Some elements are repeated on the page when this is not needed.</li>
            <li><strong>A</strong>lignment: Steakfry's website has poor alignment. The content goes off the screen horizontally requiring the user to scroll both vertically and sideways. The spacing is also inconsistent between elements in the same section.</li>
            <li><strong>P</strong>roximity: The biggest problem with proximity on this page is that links to external websites, which should be grouped together, are on opposite sides of the page. </li>
        </ul>
