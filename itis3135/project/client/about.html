        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Catholic Campus Ministry is a fun-spirited group of young adults seeking to continue their faith journey in the college environment. Mass is held on Sundays at 5:00pm at St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church, just a few blocks from campus. CCM also meets each Wednesday night at 6:30pm in the Campus Ministry Center next to St. Thomas Aquinas.</p>
<p>CCM Week is held at the beginning of each semester with events such as Mass, Rosary, field days, Top Golf, bowling, movie nights, and escape rooms each day of the week for new and returning members to ease into the semester through engaging activities with this faith-based organization.</p>
<p>Throughout the semester, Wednesday Night Dinners highlight a meal with interactive speakers and events to promote the Catholic faith and a greater intimacy with God. Rotating through spiritual, social, and service weeks, CCM provides a range of experiences for its members to socialize with friends, serve, and learn in this faith-centered environment. On spiritual nights, speakers give talks and answer questions pertaining to the yearâ€™s theme, Liturgy and the Sacraments. Other activities include praise and worship, Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, and Rosary nights. Social events allow for lively evenings with bonfires, games, dances, and more! Service nights bring the group together in giving themselves and their time both in the Charlotte and St. Thomas Aquinas communities supporting pro-life and homeless ministries.</p>
<p>CCM also participates in events hosted by the Diocese of Charlotte such as the annual Eucharistic Congress and diocesan-wide retreats for college students. We are also active with the Knights of Columbus, assisting them with fundraisers and events.</p>
